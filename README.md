# The Crest Factor

The Crest Factor is a specification designed to measure the reliability of an application or a system.

## Why

This manifest was created by the need of a common standardization to measure how reliable is an application or system.

## What

In Eletrical Engineering, the Crest Factor is used for describing the quality of an AC power waveform. In other words, crest factor indicates how extreme the peaks are in a waveform. A Crest factor of 1 indicates no peaks, such as direct current or a square wave. Higher crest factors indicate peaks, for example sound waves tend to have high crest factors.

A theorical application with a crest factor of 1 is one hundred percent reliable, meaning that it is one hundred percent in compliance with every single criteria  by the standardization.

## How

The Crest Factor is measured by how an application or system is in compliance with the following:
- Documentation
- Monitoring (Logging, Alerting, Metrics)
- High Availability (Self-Healing, Change Management, Emergency Response, Capacity Planning, Business Continuity)
- Security (Secret Management, Data Protection, Access Management, Vulnerability Assessment)
- Performance (Latency, Efficiency, Scalability)
